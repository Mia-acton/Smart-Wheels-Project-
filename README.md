Project: Smart Wheels Project 

Description: This project incorporates...
- An alcohol detection sensor (MQ3) that tests for the presence of alcohol upon system initialisation.
- A fire sensor (MQ2) that continously checks for potential fires and prints a warning message to the user upon detection, as well as a flashing LED for further warning.
- The gas sensor (MQ5) also works in a continous loop to ensure that the gas threshold stays below a certain level, with a buzzer sounding if the gas level goes above this value and is therfore a health hazard and could preclude to other potential fire hazards (smoke detection).
- The RoboCar operates via motor control and can move forward and backward.
  
Project Targets: Semester 2
- Include a GPS sensor to track the Robocars' location at all times, potentially including a push button for emergency situations that would trigger an alert.
- Use speed sensors to monitor the speed of each respective wheel to ensure each wheel stays at the same speed to avoid slip and slide, thus helping combat hazardous driving conditions.
- Bluetooth functionality to control motor direction.
- Further improve the website to make it as readable and accessible as possible for the user.
